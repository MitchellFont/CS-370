Current/Emerging Trends in CS

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  My contribution to this project involved developing the logic for the pirate's movement, enabling it to reach the treasure. This included mapping potential routes and optimizing the path to the loot.  I was given the pirate's starting position as a basis for my work.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  Computer scientists solve problems and fulfill requests by designing and implementing software solutions.  In today's world, this ability to improve efficiency and quality of life makes their work essential.
  
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  Computer scientists typically approach problems in three stages: problem definition, planning, and implementation. While the duration of each stage can vary, a thorough understanding of the problem and a solid plan are crucial for success.  A well-defined plan simplifies the implementation process, and in this project, the clear outline made the planning and implementation stages straightforward.  Conversely, attempting to implement a solution without a proper plan can significantly hinder progress.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  As a computer scientist, my ethical responsibilities to end-users and organizations include prioritizing user safety and well-being while striving to improve their quality of life, often through increased efficiency.  While users may desire personalized experiences, respecting their privacy is paramount.  Developing systems that collect personal data or predict user preferences, while potentially innovative, must avoid biases, such as racial bias.  Continuous evaluation of potential risks associated with any technological advancement is also crucial.  Ultimately, the goal should be to serve the best interests of the end-user and the organization, prioritizing positive impact and experience over financial gain.
